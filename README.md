# snipstrom
## snipstrom - url shortener
```
usage:

- change your rootUrl etc to config.js
- npm install
- npm start

curl --data "url=http://www.yliseppo.com" http://localhost:3000/shorten; echo
-> you will receive the shortened url

curl localhost:3000/id/xxxxxx
-> you will be 301 redirected to the full url

this still needs a lot of work :)
```
